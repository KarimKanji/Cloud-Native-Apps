In this course I worked in the order service with Sebastian Fallström and Oscar Weber. The 
order services primary focus was to receive the orders that come from the front end and 
serve as a hub for the entire business. There order process is one of the more critical parts 
of the entire business considering that the customer won’t receive their items if we don’t do 
our part, nor will the business receive money. To fulfill our task as the order service, we used 
NodeJS as our programming framework, MongoDb as our database (+Mongoose) and 
Azure to host our service (Orders (Takes a while to load ~2min)). To access our API you 
need to use the JWT token provided by Security (Ville Hjelt)
